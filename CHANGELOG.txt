Change Log
==========
1.0 (04/07/2022)
----------------
- First Release

1.1 (03/08/2022)
----------------
- Issues regarding loading Numpy arrays are fixed
- Issues Random visualization of sample are fixed

1.1.1 (15/12/2022)
----------------

1.1.1 (22/11/2023)
----------------
- Fixed edge pixel issue in prediction patch generation to ensure entire image is patched
- Added GDAL to automatically installed packages

1.2 (27/07/2025)
----------------
- Added generate_detection method to TrainPatch for object detection with YOLO-format bounding box annotations
- Modified generate_segmentation and generate_detection to apply augmentations (V_flip, H_flip, Rotation)
  only for format="npy", not for format="tif", to prevent shape mismatch errors

1.3 (28/07/2025)
----------------
- Added `generate_from_shapefile` method to `TrainPatch` for generating patches from polygon shapefiles, supporting segmentation and/or object detection
- Updated `generate_from_shapefile` to reproject shapefiles to WGS84 (EPSG:4326) before clipping and rasterization to prevent label mismatches due to CRS issues
- Removed redundant `shapefile_path` parameter in `generate_from_shapefile`, using `label` from `TrainPatch` initialization
- Added dependencies (`geopandas`, `shapely`, `scikit-image`) to support shapefile processing and bounding box generation
