Change Log
==========
1.0 (04/07/2022)
- First Release

1.1 (03/08/2022)
- Fixed issues with loading NumPy arrays
- Fixed random visualization of samples

1.1.1 (15/12/2022)
- Fixed visualization issues in Linux environments
- Added `PredictionPatch` class for generating prediction patches

1.1.1 (22/11/2023)
- Fixed edge pixel issue in prediction patch generation to ensure entire image is patched
- Added GDAL to automatically installed packages

1.2 (27/07/2025)
- Added `generate_detection` method to `TrainPatch` for object detection with YOLO-format bounding box annotations
- Modified `generate_segmentation` and `generate_detection` to apply augmentations (V_flip, H_flip, Rotation) only for `format="npy"`, not for `format="tif"`, to prevent shape mismatch errors

1.3 (28/07/2025)
- Added support for generating patches from polygon shapefiles in `TrainPatch`, enabling segmentation and/or object detection
- Updated shapefile processing to reproject to WGS84 (EPSG:4326) before clipping and rasterization to prevent label mismatches due to CRS issues
- Removed redundant `shapefile_path` parameter in `generate_from_shapefile`, using `label` and `label_field` from `TrainPatch` initialization
- Added dependencies (`geopandas`, `shapely`, `scikit-image`) to support shapefile processing and bounding box generation

1.3.1 (28/07/2025)
- minor bugs resolved

1.3.2 (28/07/2025)
- Removed verbose print statements in `preprocess_and_rasterize` function to streamline output and improve user experience
- Updated `TrainPatch` initialization to explicitly handle `shapefile_path` and `label_field` parameters for clarity
- Improved documentation to reflect updated `TrainPatch` usage with shapefile inputs
